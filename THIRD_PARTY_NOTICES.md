# Third-Party Notices

The root AGPL-3.0-only license and SPDX headers apply only to material for
which the Project Authors hold the necessary rights. They do not replace or
override third-party terms.

This audit covers the current repository and its Git history. Upstream
revisions inspected in September 2026 are recorded below so the findings can
be reproduced.

## Authorship of the integration and adaptations

Eva Ozturk's GSoC 2026 work integrates existing scientific methods into the
pre-existing IEEG application. It includes the analysis interfaces and data
pipeline connections, background execution, result displays and expert review,
metadata/export handling, long-recording adaptations, and MATLAB-to-Python
translation of Spike-Gamma. These are software engineering and adaptation
contributions; the underlying algorithms and pretrained models are the work of
the upstream authors identified below. Some integration code itself is derived
from upstream workflows, as detailed in the component notices.

Credit for this work does not replace upstream attribution or establish a right
to relicense source-derived translations or adaptations. The root AGPL applies
only where the necessary rights are held; existing permission gaps remain open.

## Recruitment Energy Index: BrainQuake and IEEG_EI

Affected files:

- `app/computation/rei/algorithm.py`
- `app/computation/rei/algorithm.pyi`

The core `compute_hfer`, `determine_threshold_onset`, and
`compute_ei_index` implementation follows this provenance chain:

1. [`HongLabTHU/BrainQuake`](https://github.com/HongLabTHU/BrainQuake),
   `BrainQuake/client_ictal.py`, revision
   `398492abb6440b86d447a8f6a7d83920bf241009`.
2. [`allucas/IEEG_EI`](https://github.com/allucas/IEEG_EI),
   `ei_main_gui.py`, revision
   `2dbd30bebb37e84ff6e06a168bca542ed0e2fc33`.
3. The adapted REI implementation in this repository.

A source comparison confirms that IEEG_EI retained substantial BrainQuake EI
code, with parameter and GUI changes, and that the present REI core is a
further adaptation of that code. BrainQuake is the original software source for
the shared EI core; the scientific method is credited to Bartolomei, Chauvel,
and Wendling (2008), DOI: https://doi.org/10.1093/brain/awn111. REI names this
application's adapted scoring implementation, not a new algorithm invented by
the integrator. The application uses its own GUI, not IEEG_EI's PySimpleGUI or
iEEG.org login interface.

### Verified settings and local adaptations

The comparison uses the revisions above, BrainQuake's
`BrainQuake/gui_forms/ictal_form.py` for its displayed band defaults, and the
current `app/computation/rei/algorithm.py` for this application's settings.

| Setting | BrainQuake | IEEG_EI | This application's REI |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| Default band | 60–140 Hz (GUI filter defaults) | 70–140 Hz | 60–140 Hz, editable |
| Butterworth order, forward/backward filtering | 5 | 4 | 4 |
| Onset threshold | Baseline maximum + 20σ | Baseline maximum + 10σ | Baseline maximum + 10σ |
| Baseline standard deviation | Sample SD (`ddof=1`) | Sample SD (`ddof=1`) | Sample SD (`ddof=1`) |
| Energy integration window | 0.5 s | 0.5 s | 0.5 s |
| HFER scoring interval | 0.25 s | 0.25 s | Up to 0.25 s, clipped to available samples |

Thus the current settings combine BrainQuake's band with the filter order and
threshold also used in IEEG_EI. The shared core normalizes squared, integrated
energy to baseline, ranks threshold-crossing times, combines energy with inverse
onset rank using a square root, and normalizes scores by the channel maximum.

Local changes include float64 energy normalization and zero-baseline protection,
non-empty-window checks, clipping the earliest onset and scoring interval to the
available samples, averaging over the actual clipped interval, and GUI-facing
channel/montage/notch selection, editable time windows, result objects, plots,
and exports. These changes can affect numerical results. No numerical parity
with BrainQuake or IEEG_EI is claimed.

### Licenses and provenance

BrainQuake is licensed under Apache-2.0. Its repository does not identify a
specific copyright holder in a copyright notice; it is published by the
HongLabTHU organization and licensed through its contributors. BrainQuake
contains no `NOTICE` file. Apache-2.0 requires recipients of source or object
distributions to receive the license, retain applicable copyright, patent,
trademark, and attribution notices, and mark modified files. The required
license copy is [`LICENSES/Apache-2.0.txt`](LICENSES/Apache-2.0.txt).
Apache-2.0 is compatible with AGPLv3 when its notice requirements are
preserved.

IEEG_EI identifies Alfredo Lucas through its Git history but contains no
license file, copyright notice, or explicit reuse grant. Public availability
is not a license. The licensing of Alfredo Lucas's changes, and therefore the
complete permission chain for the present REI files, remains unresolved.
Those files have not been marked AGPL-3.0-only. Not using IEEG_EI's GUI does not
by itself establish that its other changes are absent. This attribution update
is not a replacement or re-derivation of the current core: it cannot describe
IEEG_EI as a settings-only influence with a fully resolved permission chain.
That would require a separate source-level review/replacement or permission for
any remaining IEEG_EI-specific material.

## Spike-Gamma, John Thomas, Sayeed, and Radek Janča

Source: [`Lab-Frauscher/Spike-Gamma`](https://github.com/Lab-Frauscher/Spike-Gamma),
revision `487ae8bb85394b455560c639b45c5bc102b486b6`, published through the
ANPHY Lab account.

Affected files:

- `app/computation/gamma_spike/original_algorithm/compute_gamma.py`
- `app/computation/gamma_spike/original_algorithm/compute_spike_boundary.py`
- `app/computation/gamma_spike/original_algorithm/postprocessing.py`
- `app/computation/gamma_spike/original_algorithm/spike_detector_hilbert_v25.py`
- helper/refactoring files in the same directory
- `app/computation/gamma_spike/wire_algorithm.py`, whose compatibility logic
  is closely tied to the translated workflow

Eva Ozturk translated and adapted the MATLAB workflow for this application's
Python analysis pipeline and GUI. This includes segmented execution and result
review/export integration, not invention of the spike detector, boundary rules,
or gamma-measurement algorithm. MATLAB-to-Python translation remains a
source-derived adaptation for the purposes of this notice.

The upstream file notices identify:

- `compute_gamma.m`: John Thomas, `john007@e.ntu.edu.sg`, created
  1 July 2021.
- `compute_spike_boundary.m`: John Thomas,
  `john007@e.ntu.edu.sg`, created 1 March 2022.
- `postprocessing.m`: Sayeed and John Thomas, created 23 April 2021; the
  header states that reuse requires contacting the authors.
- `spike_detector_hilbert_v25.m`: Radek Janča (`ISARG`), dated
  19 September 2013, and citing the Janča et al. detector publication.

The repository does not state who legally owns these copyrights. Its README
provides only a research-use statement: academic and research use is intended,
and commercial or non-academic users must contact the authors. Several source
headers separately require contact for reuse. There is no standard license
text or explicit permission to redistribute, modify, or sublicense the code.

These terms do not supply permission to relicense the translations under
AGPL-3.0-only and appear incompatible with unrestricted AGPL distribution.
No SPDX declaration was added to these files and no invented license copy was
created. Written permission or a clarified upstream license is required before
distribution.

## HFO candidate detectors: HFODetector

The application imports `HFODetector==0.0.25` from
[`roychowdhuryresearch/HFO_Detector`](https://github.com/roychowdhuryresearch/HFO_Detector).
The package is not vendored, but `app/computation/hfo/detectors/` and the HFO
orchestration reproduce the parameterization used by Omni-iEEG.

The installed package metadata names Xin Chen and Hoyoung Chung as authors.
Its included license identifies UCLA as the institution/copyright holder and
names Yipeng Zhang, Xin Chen, Hoyoung Chung, Lawrence Liu, Yuanyi Ding, Hiroki
Nariai, and Vwani Roychowdhury as creators.

The UCLA Academic Software License permits use and derivative works only by
academic or nonprofit researchers for educational or academic research. It
prohibits further transfer of the software and derivatives, requires a
specified acknowledgment in academic publications, disclaims warranties, and
directs commercial entities to obtain a separate license. A copy is
at [`LICENSES/UCLA-Academic-Software-License.txt`](LICENSES/UCLA-Academic-Software-License.txt).

Because HFODetector is installed separately, its code is not being relicensed
by this repository. Its non-transfer and field-of-use restrictions are
nevertheless incompatible with AGPL distribution of a bundled application and
must be reviewed before distributing an installer or environment containing
the package.

## pyHFO classifiers and checkpoints

Sources:

- [`roychowdhuryresearch/pyHFO`](https://github.com/roychowdhuryresearch/pyHFO),
  revision `c1c7d3fec990e8661604080664766dc1297cbfdc`. Relevant upstream
  files: `src/model.py`, `src/hfo_feature.py`, `src/classifer.py`,
  `ckpt/model_a.tar`, `ckpt/model_s.tar`.
- [`roychowdhuryresearch/HFO-Classification`](https://github.com/roychowdhuryresearch/HFO-Classification),
  `Pruning-pipeline`, revision
  `f96ef79894e3752bf185d60ceb1eb86a48f58f21`. Relevant upstream files:
  `Pruning-pipeline/src/model.py`, `Pruning-pipeline/feature_extraction.py`,
  `Pruning-pipeline/src/utils_features.py`.

Affected code was under
`app/computation/hfo/classification/_pyhfo_binary_common/` and related
classifier/orchestration modules.

The following files, previously bundled, were byte-identical to pyHFO
upstream checkpoints:

- `model_a.tar` — SHA-256
  `3fea070cb08e8789a06a7db3cd7210ba56ac30fd6c21c7517fb58336872b041c`
- `model_s.tar` — SHA-256
  `5b753b3373c2da1e85d7856e27674178950f5c5c02d879ab30a0308d136cb4ba`

pyHFO and the upstream Pruning pipeline use the UCLA Academic Software
License described above. UCLA is the stated institution/copyright holder; the
license acknowledgment names Yipeng Zhang, Xin Chen, Hoyoung Chung, Lawrence
Liu, Yuanyi Ding, Hiroki Nariai, and Vwani Roychowdhury.

The license's express prohibition on further transfer means that including
these checkpoints, and the classifier/feature/model code adapted from the
same upstream sources, in a publicly distributable repository was not
authorized by that license. It was also incompatible with AGPL-3.0-only.

**Resolution:** `model_a.tar`, `model_s.tar`, and the three adapted Python
files (`classifier.py`, `features.py`, `model.py`) have been removed from
version control as of this notice's update and are excluded via
`.gitignore`. They are no longer distributed by this repository. Each user
must obtain them separately, as an academic or nonprofit researcher under the
UCLA Academic Software License; see [README.md](README.md#high-frequency-oscillations-hfo)
for what to download and where to place it. The application detects their
absence and disables the `pyhfo_pybrain` and `pyhfo_omni_legacy` routes
accordingly, defaulting to the MIT-licensed `eHFO` route instead.

These files were nonetheless present in this repository's git history and on
its public remote prior to this fix (introduced in commit `5d337b8`); that
history has not been rewritten. This notice records the compliance gap and
its resolution transparently rather than implying the files were never
exposed.

## eHFO implementation and checkpoints

Source: [`roychowdhuryresearch/HFO-Classification`](https://github.com/roychowdhuryresearch/HFO-Classification),
`Discover_eHFO`, revision
`f96ef79894e3752bf185d60ceb1eb86a48f58f21`.

Affected code is under `app/computation/hfo/classification/ehfo/` and related
classifier/orchestration modules. The following bundled files are
byte-identical to the upstream Discover_eHFO checkpoints:

- `artifacts.pth` — SHA-256
  `bb9e5a76cc41bdd384b3ee2a006f09bd1eca2552b358ec4c20dcf96ae0f0779f`
- `spikes.pth` — SHA-256
  `6bded2e3b62ad4022561cefd3e5d153a0fe7957f55c5f88e419cf974b44a0490`
- `eHFOs.pth` — SHA-256
  `bb2c8cd0f1f4579643fe932eddba3074f758807e2d5f7b6b1fbd90a31cf15f01`

Discover_eHFO is MIT-licensed, copyright © 2020 Yipeng Zhang. The MIT license
requires its copyright and permission notice to accompany copies or
substantial portions. The required copy is
[`LICENSES/eHFO-MIT.txt`](LICENSES/eHFO-MIT.txt). MIT is compatible with
AGPLv3 when its notice is retained.

Some eHFO integration also mirrors Omni-iEEG code, whose separate licensing
uncertainty remains applicable.

## Omni-iEEG-derived integration

Source: [`Omni-iEEG/Omni-iEEG`](https://github.com/Omni-iEEG/Omni-iEEG),
revision `57c22a75a59b5c3a98006806ad42000f6a3fa5b6`.

Affected or potentially affected files include:

- `app/computation/hfo/algorithm.py`
- `app/computation/hfo/classification/_pyhfo_binary_common/`
- `app/computation/hfo/classification/ehfo/`
- `app/computation/hfo/detectors/omni_hfo_detector.py`
- `app/computation/hfo/preprocessing/omni.py`
- `app/computation/hfo/preprocessing/pybrain.py`

The upstream repository identifies the Omni-iEEG organization as author in
`setup.py`, but contains no license file, copyright notice, or explicit reuse
grant. Its public availability does not authorize copying, modification, or
redistribution. No license copy can be supplied. These files remain unmarked
and require clarification or permission from Omni-iEEG before distribution.

## External packages and CI actions not vendored here
